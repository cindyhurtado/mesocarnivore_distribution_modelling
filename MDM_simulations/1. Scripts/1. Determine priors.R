# PART 4
# Commented R code describing method used to obtain
# informative prior used in the analysis of the parula dataset.
# Moldenhauer and Regelski (1996) state that home range size typically
# ranges from 0.08-0.65 ha, which equates to a radius of

sqrt(0.08/pi*10000) # 15.96 m or
sqrt(0.65/pi*10000) # 45.49 m

# Since parulas were detected by song, let's be safe and add a minimum and maximum distance at which they could be heard, 50 and 250 m, based upon Simons et al. (2009).
# So now we have an area between

(15.96+50)^2*pi / 10000  # 1.37 ha, and
(45.49+250)^2*pi / 10000 # 27.4 ha

# We note that this is a very large range.

# Following Royle et. al (2011), and assuming a
# chi-squared distribution with 2 degrees of freedom,
# the range of sigma is given by

sqrt(1.37*10000/pi)/sqrt(5.99)   # 27 m
sqrt(27.4*10000/pi)/sqrt(5.99)   # 120 m

# In our grid spacing, 1 unit = 50m, so our we want a prior with most
# of the density between:

27/50  # 0.54
121/50 # 2.42

# Gamma(13, 10) covers this nicely
#Cindy: so needs data values for gamma distribution that fit within 0.54 and 2.42?

# 5.99 is the chi square value from a significance level of 0.05 with 2 degrees of freedom.
